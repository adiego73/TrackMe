\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
Nowadays, due to the availability of a huge variety of smart electronic devices, more and more applications are developed to help people in their day-to-day activities. In the healthcare field, wearable devices such as smart-watches are highly useful. As they can be used to collect information about general well-being of users by means of mobile sensor technologies. As expected, measured data has several possible applications including, patient diagnostics and treatment or research motivations. \\

\textbf{TrackMe} is a company which offers cost-effective, easy-to-use and non-invasive wearable health devices. In order to provide new features to their users, TrackMe decided to develop a software-based service called \textbf{Data4Help}. This service aims, under certain constraints, to allow registered third parties to monitor location and health status of individuals. \\

TrackMe serves not only as a simple tool to track objects on-line, but it can also be a lifesaver. To exploit data acquired through Data4Help and offer personalized services, TrackMe decided to release \textbf{AutomatedSOS} and \textbf{Track4Run}. AutomatedSOS service is a non-intrusive SOS service for the elderly people designed to keep track of health status, going beyond in ensuring the safety of your beloved ones, keeping them safe, in case of emergency. On the other hand, Track4Run service allows organizers to define the path for the run, participants to enrol in the run and to track athletes participating in a run.\\

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
\textbf{TrackMe} offers to their customers a new service called \textbf{Data4Help}, when they agree provides the user, an interface for the registration of individuals who, by registering, agree that TrackMe acquires their data. They are wirelessly connected to each other, and all that needs to be done is to view them either using a simple PC or a smart-phone. Also, it supports the registration of third parties, who can thereafter request for the data of some specific individuals (using SSN) and the request will be sent to the respective individuals (who can Accept or Reject it) or can ask for bulk data based on some filtering criteria provided by the system (such as age, gender, country, province) which will be handled directly by TrackMe (Requests accepted only if, for which the number of individuals whose data satisfy the request is higher than 1000). As the request for data acquisition is approved, TrackMe offers third party customers to subscribe to the new data (if they want to), in order to receive new data as soon as it is produced.\\

\textbf{AutomatedSOS} is built on the top of Data4Help, which gives an opportunity to the people above the age of 50 years, if they want to subscribe to this new SOS service. AutomatedSOS monitors the health status of the subscribed customers and, when vital signs parameters (Heart rate, Blood pressure) are below certain thresholds, sends to the location of the customer an ambulance, guaranteeing a reaction time of less than 5 seconds from the time the parameters	are	below the threshold.\\

\textbf{Track4Run} allows the 'fit' customers to participate in the upcoming run (by sending a request), if they accept it, they will be redirected to the page where, they can enrol themselves to the run.\\

\subsubsection{World and Machine Phenomenon}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{World Phenomenon}
\\
\\
In TrackMe system, the portions of the world which machine cannot observe are classified as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} Wearable devices (Smartwatches or similar devices)
\item{} Individuals (who are sharing their personal data after successful registration)
\item{} Third party customers (who registers in TrackMe and are willing to use the data acquired using Data4Help)
\item{} Ambulance 
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Machine Phenomenon}
\\
\\
This contains the Portion of the system to be developed for the world which is explained as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The system allows to monitor the location and health data of the individuals, specially the vital signs (Blood Pressure, Body Temperature and heart Rate).
\item{} The system allows the third parties to subscribe to the new data produced automatically in real-time.
\item{} The system uses database queries to get data of the specific individuals or get anonymous data of group of people, based on the filtering criteria provided to the system (such as, Filter data based on age, gender, country etc.).
\item{} The system saves the previously provided data and provide them if needed, in case of emergency. 
\item{} The system helps the third parties to monitor the health status of the elderly people through AutomatedSOS.
\item{} The system sends a notification to the ambulance the exact location when the health parameters falls below the pre-defined threshold value.
\item{} The system helps the organizers to define the path of the run.
\item{} The system notifies the registered users to enrol to the run before the notification expires (a time-to-reply constraint has been imposed by the system).
\item{} The system allows registered users to see the athletes on the map only during the run (the location is not accessible before or after the run).
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Shared Phenomenon}
\\
\\
The Shared Phenomenon between the real world and TrackMe (Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run) is classified as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} The data collected by the devices (i.e. Blood pressure, Body temperature, Heart rate)
\item{} Individuals location and health status
\item{} Ambulance contact numbers (emergency number)
\item{} Defined path for the run
\item{} The current location of the athletes participating during the run
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Data4Help}}\\
$[G1]$ Provide a service capable to store the location and physical data of an individual obtained by means of TrackMe's smart devices\\
$[G2]$ Provide a service that let a third party company to access the stored data from an individual\\
$[G3]$ Provide a service that let a third party company to access anonymized stored data of groups of individuals subject to specified constraints\\
$[G4]$ Provide to a third party company a way to get updates on a specific individual's data or of a previously saved search of anonymized data\\

\item{\textbf{AutomatedSOS}}\\
$[G5]$ Provide a service capable to send an advice to the health care service when a individual's parameters are below a defined threshold\\

\item{\textbf{Track4Run}}\\
$[G6]$ Provide a platform that let races organizer to define race's path, and let the participants to enroll to them\\
$[G7]$ Provide to run spectators a way to watch the participants' location during the race\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item{} \textbf{Wearable Device}: Wearable technology is a blanket term for electronics that can be worn on the body. It has the ability to connect to the internet, enabling data to be exchanged between a network and the device wirelessly.
