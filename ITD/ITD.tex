When the system passes all the test cases and end-2-end scenarios (illustrated in chapter-6 in detail) without fail and the system is 100\% on-line with all the requirements stated about are implemented and working properly and making the system stable. Based on which a go/no-go decision can be taken, firstly a beta-version of the product can be published.
	
	\chapter{Adopted development frameworks}
In the following chapter a list of development frameworks and technologies that are used in building the entire TrackMe system are listed. The Data4Help and AutomatedSOS systems, are designed to be highly decoupled even though they are developed with the same technologies.
	\section{Adopted Programming Languages}
	The Programming languages that are used in building the system are following:
	\subsection{Java} Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
	
	\subsubsection{Advantages}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{Object-oriented}:Allows you to create modular programs and reusable code. 
	\item{Platform-Independent}:Ability to move easily from one computer system to another. 
		\item{Distributed}:Designed to make distributed computing easy with the networking capability that is inherently integrated into it.
		\item{Secure}:The Java language, compiler, interpreter, and runtime environment were each developed with security in mind.
		\item{Allocation}: Java has the feature of Stack allocation system. It helps the data to be stored and can be restored easily.
		\item{Multithreaded}: The capability for a program to perform several tasks simultaneously within a program.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{Performance}: Significantly slower and more memory-consuming than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.
	\item{Look and Feel}: The default look and feel of GUI applications written in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications.
		\item{Single paradigm language}: The addition of static imports in Java 5.0 the procedural paradigm is better accommodated than in earlier versions of Java.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{SQL}(Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). 
\subsubsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{} SQL Queries can be used to retrieve large amounts of records from a database quickly and efficiently.
\item{} SQL is used to view the data without storing the data into the object.
\item{} SQL joins two or more tables and show it as one object to user.
\item{} SQL databases use long-established standard, which is being adopted by ANSI \&amp; ISO. Non-SQL databases do not adhere to any clear standard.
\item{} Using standard SQL it is easier to manage database systems without having to write substantial amount of code.
\item{} SQL restricts the access of a table so that nobody can insert the rows into the table.
	\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{} Interfacing an SQL database is more complex than adding a few lines of code.
\item{} When table is dropped view becomes inactive. It depends on the table objects.
\item{} Although SQL databases conform to ANSI \&amp; ISO standards, some databases go for proprietary extensions to standard SQL to ensure vendor lock-in.
\item{} It is an object so it occupies space.
	\end{itemize} 

	\section{Adopted Middle-wares}
	To begin with, it is suggested to build Java based applications, since developers have expertise working with this language. Moreover, the proposed frameworks are:
\subsection{Java Spark Framework} Java Spark Framework is a simple and expressive Java/Kotlin web framework DSL built for rapid development. Sparks intention is to provide an alternative for Kotlin/Java developers that want to develop their web applications as expressive as possible and with minimal boilerplate. With a clear philosophy Spark is designed not only to make you more productive, but also to make your code better under the influence of Spark’s sleek, declarative and expressive syntax. It is a micro-framework for MVC applications, because pure Java web development has traditionally been very cumbersome. The configuration for this framework is minimal and with a short learning curve.

\subsubsection{Advantages}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Fast and lightweight
	\item{} Excellent for rapid prototyping
	\item{} Easy to setup
	\item{} Most commonly used with AngularJS
	\item{} Real micro-framework
	\item{} Uses Jetty
	\item{} Can be used inside a container or without one
		\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
			\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Documentation could be better, it is not intended for beginners.
		\item{} Not suitable for large projects
		\item{} Small community
		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Morphia Framework} MongoDB is an open source document-oriented NoSQL database system which stores data as JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.  As it doesn't store data in tables as is done in the usual relational database setup, it doesn't map well to the JPA way of storing data. Morphia is an open source lightweight type-safe library designed to bridge the gap between the MongoDB Java driver and domain objects. It can be an alternative to SpringData if you're not using the Spring Framework to interact with MongoDB.

\subsubsection{Advantages}

		\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Stable
	\item{} Very good play integration
	\item{} Offers access to all Mongo driver features
	\item{} Provides more extensiblity leading you to enjoy the ability to suck most out of mongo features
	\item{} Lightweight
		\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
			\begin{itemize}
		\item{} Does not have serializers for enumeration type
		\end{itemize}
		
\subsection{Lettuce Framework} Lettuce is a fully non-blocking Redis client built with netty providing Reactive, Asynchronous and Synchronous Data Access. Lettuce connects with all operational models natively supported by Redis. Partition-tolerance, Read Slaves and Transport-Level-Security provide the required foundation for highly scalable applications.
\subsubsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Standalone
\item{} Providing synchronous, asynchronous and reactive APIs
\item{} Partition-tolerance
\item{} Dynamic API
\item{} Cloud ready
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Angular Framework} It is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
\subsubsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Two way data binding
\item{} Directives
\item{} Dependency injection
\item{} Community
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Performance
\item{} Steep learning curve

\end{itemize}

	






	\section{Additional APIs}
The only external APIs to whom TrackMe environment depends on, are the health-care services to which ASOS should contact in some cases. Both D4H and T4R do not depend on any external services.

	\chapter{Integration Strategy}
	\section{Entry Criteria}
	\label{sec:Entry Criteria}
	In order for the integration testing to be possible and to produce meaningful results, there are a number of conditions on the progress of the project that have to be met.\\
	\quad First of all, the \textbf{Requirements Analysis and Specification Document} and the \textbf{Design Document} must have been fully written. This is a required step in order to have a complete picture of the interactions between the different components of the system and of the functionalities they offer.\\
	\quad Secondly, the integration process should start only when the estimated percentage of completion of every component with respect to its functionalities is:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{}\textbf{100\%} for the \textbf{Data4HelpWebService} component
		\item{}At least \textbf{90\%} for the \textbf{LoginService and RegisterService} subsystem
		\item{}At least \textbf{70\%} for the \textbf{SearchManager and RequestService} subsystem
		\item{}At least \textbf{50\%} for the \textbf{ASOSService} applications
		
	\end{itemize}
	It should be noted that these percentages refer to the status of the project at the beginning of the integration testing phase and they do not represent the minimum completion percentage necessary to consider a component for integration, which must be at least \textbf{90\%}. The choice of having different completion percentages for the different components has been made to reflect
their order of integration and to take into account the required time to fully perform integration testing.

	\section{Elements to be integrated}
	In the following paragraph we're going to provide a list of all the components that need to be integrated together.\\
	As specified in TrackMe Design Document, the system is built upon the interactions of many high-level components, each one implementing a specific set of functionalities. For the sake of modularity, each subsystem is further obtained by the combination of several lower-level components. Because of this software architecture, the integration phase will involve the integration of components at two different levels of abstraction.\\
	
	At the lowest level, we'll integrate together those components that depend strongly on one another to offer the higher level functionalities of \textbf{Data4HelpWebService}. In our specific case, this involves the integration of the \textbf{Login Service and Signup Service}, \textbf{Search Management}, \textbf{Request Management}, \textbf{Subscription and Notification Management} subcomponents in order to obtain the \textbf{Data4Help Management System} subsystem.\\
	
	For what concerns the building of the \textbf{AutomatedSOS} and \textbf{Track4Run} subsystems, the integration activity is actually quite limited; in fact, they simply represent a collection of functionalities belonging to the same area which however are not dependent on one another. As a result of this, their subcomponents don't really interact with each other, and the integration phase will be limited to the task of ensuring that the set of functionalities of each subcomponent is properly exposed by the subsystem. The components involved in this phase are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{} The \textbf{Data Handler, Health Care Connector and DB Manger} subcomponents in order to obtain the \textbf{AutomatedSOS subsystem}.
	\item{} The \textbf{Login, Signup, User, Event, Notification, Data handler, Request and  Authentication manager} subcomponents in order to obtain the \textbf{Track4Run Management subsystem}.
	\end{itemize}
		Some of these subcomponents also directly rely on higher level, atomic components: that is the case, for instance, of the dependency on the \textbf{Data Handler component}. These dependencies will be taken care of in the integration process.\\
		Finally, we will proceed with the integration of the higher level subsystems. In particular, the integration activity will involve:
	\begin{itemize}
		
	\item{} The already existing components used to achieve
specific functionalities: these are the \textbf{Health Care Service, DBMS and Notification system} components.
\item{} Those components and subsystems specifically developed for TrackMeService, that are:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{} On the server side: the \textbf{Data4Help Management System, Authentication system, Search subsystems}, together with the \textbf{Data Handler} component.
	\item{} On the client side: the \textbf{Data4Help Web Application and Track4Run Web Application} components.
	\end{itemize}
			
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Integration testing strategy}
	As already explained in the Design document, let's discuss here Integration strategy in more detail. The approach we're going to use to perform integration testing is based on a mixture of the bottom-up and critical-module-first integration strategies.\\
	
	Using the bottom-up approach, we will start integrating together those components that do not depend on other components to function, or that only depend on already developed components. This strategy brings a number of important advantages. First, it allows us to perform integration tests on "real" components that are almost fully developed and thus obtain more precise indications about how the system may react and fail in real world usage with respect to a top-down approach. Secondly, working bottom-up enables us to more closely follow the development process, which in our case is also proceeding using the bottom-up approach; by doing this we can start performing integration testing earlier in the development process as soon as the required components have been developed in order to maximize parallelism and efficiency.\\
	
	Since subsystems are fairly independent from one another, the order in which they're integrated together to obtain the full system follows the critical-module-first approach. This strategy allows us to concentrate our testing efforts on the riskiest components first, that is those that represent the core functionalities of the whole system and whose malfunctioning could pose a very serious threat to the correct implementation of the entire TrackMe infrastructure. By proceeding this way, we are able to discover bugs earlier in the integration progress and take the necessary measures to correct them on time.\\
	
	It should be noted that \textbf{Health Care Service, Notification System and DBMS} are commercial components that
have already been developed and can thus be immediately used in a bottom-up approach without any explicit dependency.
			
	\section{Sequence of Component/Function Integration}
	This section describes the order of integration (and integration testing) of the various components and subsystems of TrackMe Service. This section has already been explained in detail in the \textbf{DD} - Design Document \textbf{(Reference section: 5.3.3 Integration order)}.
			
	\chapter{Individual Steps and Test Description}
	In this chapter we'll provide a detailed description of the tests to be performed on each pair of components that have to be integrated.Each pair of components is described in a specific subsection, identified by the $<$caller;called$>$ notation, containing the list of methods that the $<$caller$>$ component invokes on the $<$called$>$ component.For each method we're going to provide a brief description of the input values and the corresponding expected effects on the system.

	\chapter{Required Program Stubs and Test Data}
	\section{Program Stubs and Drivers}
	As we have mentioned in the Integration Testing Strategy section of this document, we are going to adopt a bottom-up approach to component integration and testing.\\
	
	Because of this choice, we are going to need a number of drivers to actually perform the necessary method invocations on the components to be tested; this will be mainly accomplished in conjunction with the JUnit framework.\\
	
	Here follows a list of all the drivers that will be developed as part of the integration testing phase, together with their specific role:
	\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Data Access Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{DB Handler} component in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Manager}.
\item{\textbf{Request Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Request Management} subcomponent, including those with package - level visibility, in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler, Notification System and the Subscription Management} components.
\item{\textbf{Search Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Subscription Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler, Notification System and the Request Management} components.
\item{\textbf{Login Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Login Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler and the token System} components.
\item{\textbf{Health Care Connector Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Health Care Connector Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler and the Health Care Service - external System} components.
\item{\textbf{Notification Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Notification Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler, Request system and Search system} components.
\item{\textbf{Subscription Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Subscription Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler and Search system} components.
\item{\textbf{Account Management Driver}} : this testing module will invoke the methods exposed by the \textbf{Check Token Management} subcomponent in order to test its interaction with the \textbf{DB Handler, Login system and Signup system} components.
\end{itemize}
	
	While the bottom-up approach in general doesn't require the usage of any stubs as the system is developed from the ground up, a full test of the core system isn't possible without introducing a few of them. In fact, there is a mutual dependency between the clients (which send requests) and the core system (which replies to them). Since we are developing and integrating the system from the core, we are going to introduce stubs to simulate the presence of clients until they are fully developed. In practice, the only purpose of these stubs is to write on a log that they have correctly received the messages.

	\section{Test Data}
In order to be able to perform the record of tests that we have specified, we are going to need:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid individual or third party users to test the \textbf{Signup Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} Invalid data in one or more fields
\item{} Tax certificate not compliant with the legal format
\item{} Valid data in all fields
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid individual or third party users to test the \textbf{Login Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} Invalid data in one or more fields
\item{} valid data but system down
\item{} Valid data in all fields
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid requests to test the \textbf{Request Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} Invalid data in one or more fields
\item{} valid data but incorrect format
\item{} Valid data in all fields
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid searches to test the \textbf{Search Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} Invalid data in search
\item{} valid data but does not exist in DB
\item{} Valid data
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid searches to test the \textbf{Subscription Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} valid data but does not exist in DB
\item{} Valid data
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid notifications to test the \textbf{Notification Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Null fields
\item{} valid data but does not exist in DB
\item{} Valid data
\end{itemize}
\item{} A list of both valid and invalid notifications to test the \textbf{Health Care Service Management} component. The set should contain instances exhibiting the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item{} Null object
\item{} Inconsistent data against threshold
\item{} Consistent data against threshold
\item{} Valid data
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
More specific information about the required test data can be found by analysing the inputs of all the test cases described in chapter 3.
	
	\section{Test Scenario}
Scenario testing is a software testing activity that uses scenarios: hypothetical stories to help the tester work through a complex problem or test system. The ideal scenario test is a credible, complex, compelling or motivating story the outcome of which is easy to evaluate. The following high-level set of scenarios were considered for \textbf{Data4Help} system:

	\section{Test Cases}
	A  test case is a specification of the inputs, execution conditions, testing procedure, and expected results that define a single test to be executed to achieve a particular software testing objective. We will define a number of test cases against the test scenarios above stated to cover the Data4Help complete system. The following test cases are considered against the test scenarios:

	\chapter{Installation instructions}
The TrackMe project is composed by 3 different systems: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS, and Track4Run. We decided to develop Data4Help, which is the leading system, and AutomatedSOS.

	\section{How to run both systems?}
	The whole system is dockerized, just run the follow the following steps:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Install \href{https://docs.docker.com/install/}{\textbf{Docker}} and \href{https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/}{\textbf{Docker Compose}}.
	\item At the level of \textit{TrackMe/src} folder, open a terminal and execute
	\textbf{ sudo docker-compose up} (with --build to rebuild the image).
	\item Open the browser and you can access to the Data4Help site using the following URL
		\textbf{http://0.0.0.0:4200}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{How to run the tests image?}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item After installing \textit{Docker} and \textit{Docker compose} and in the src folder, execute in a terminal: 
	\textbf{sudo docker-compose -f  ------>s}
	\item This will run all the unit test cases and will exit. If the exit code is 0 and you see \textbf{Tests run: XX, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0}, everything is ok.
	\end{enumerate}
	 
	\section{How to each system independently?}
	\subsection{How to work on the back-end?}
	The following are the steps needed to work on the back-end:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item You will need \href{https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}{\textbf{JDK}}  $>$= 8.
	\item Install \href{https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html}{\textbf{Apache Maven}}. 
	\item Install \href{https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/}{\textbf{MongoDB}}  and \href{https://redis.io/download}{\textbf{Redis}}.
	\item In the folder \textit{TrackMe/src/data4help/}, open a terminal and run \textbf{mvn compile}.
	\item \textit{[Optional]} To run the service:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Make sure that MongoDB and Redis services are running.
		\item Execute the following line:\\
		\textbf{ mvn -X compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=avila.schiatti.virdi.Main -e}.
		\item You will be able to access the site/services by accessing to \textbf{http://127.1.1.1:4567}
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\textit{	In order to be able to have the front end, you should follow the steps of the front-end section, without running it}	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{How to work on the front-end?}
	In order to work on the front-end, follow this steps:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Install \href{https://nodejs.org/es/download/}{\textbf{Nodejs and NPM}}.
	\item Install \href{https://cli.angular.io/}{\textbf{AngularCLI }} by running the following line:\textbf{ npm install -g @angular/cli }
	\item Go to \textit{src/main/resources} folder and install the package dependencies running: \textbf{npm install}
	\item Build the project by running \textbf{ng build}.
	\item To run the front-end, you can run: \textbf{ng serve}. You will be able to access the front-end by accessing to \textbf{http://127.1.1.1:4200} 
	
	\textit{You won't have access to the back-end services, so probably the front-end alone is not useful)}
	\end{enumerate}
