Wearable devices for Physiological Sensing
it has sensors used to monitor physiological parameters. 
The wrist can be used to obtain a vast amount of physiological signals such as temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation 
or bioelectronics 

------------------> Heart rate (HR) or pulse is the frequency of cardiac cycles, and is expressed as beats per minute (bpm)
Age	Target Heart Rate (beats per minute)
20	100 to 150
25	98 to 146
30	95 to 142
35	93 to 138
40	90 to 135
45	88 to 131
50	85 to 127
55	83 to 123
60	80 to 120
65	78 to 116
70	75 to 113
75	73 to 109

------------------> Body temperature can be estimated from the skin temperature, which can be measured with infrared thermopile (°F)
Body temperatures based on the age are estimated as
Babies and children. Ranges from 97.9°F (36.6°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).
Adults. Ranges from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).
Adults over age 65. In older adults, the average body temperature is lower than 98.6°F (36.2°C).

Normal‎: ‎36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F)	Hypothermia‎: ‎<35.0 °C (95.0 °F)
Fever‎: ‎>37.5 or 38.3 °C (99.5 or 100.9 °F)	Hyperthermia‎: ‎>37.5 or 38.3 °C (99.5 or 100.9 ...

------------------> Blood pressure: systolic, diastolic (mmHg). Pulse oximeter.
Usually ranges between 90 to 250 for the top or maximum number (systolic) and 60 to 140 for the bottom or minimum number (diastolic).
(Blood pressure readings have two numbers, for example 140/90mmHg). 
----- What the different blood pressure readings mean ----
Less than 120 over 80: Your blood pressure is normal and healthy. 
Between 120 over 80 and 140 over 90: Your blood pressure is a little higher than it should be.
140 over 90 or higher (over a number of weeks): You have high blood pressure. 

------------------> Blood Oxygen Saturation Level 
The normal oxygen saturation level is 97–100%. Levels under 90 percent are considered low.
