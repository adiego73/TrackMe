# TrackMe project
The TrackMe project is composed by 3 different systems: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS, and Track4Run.
We decided to develop only Data4Help, which is the leading system, and AutomatedSOS.

## How to run the systems?
There are few steps to run both systems.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. In a terminal and from this folder run: `docker-compose up`
1. Open the browser and you can access to the Data4Help site using the following URL: `http://0.0.0.0:4567`
